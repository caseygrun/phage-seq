$schema: "https://json-schema.org/draft-06/schema#"
description: metadata.csv. Specifies parameters of each selection. Each row represents a single selection. Columns describe parameters of the selection, including the bacterial strains used for selection and counter-selection. The following columns are required. Additional columns can be added to identify phenotypes associated with the selection

  antigen:
  	description: Which antigen is targeted by this selection
  	type: string
  background_CS:
  	description: Genetic background for the counter-selection strain

  	description: Genotype of the counter-selection strain, relative to the genetic background
  	type: string
  strain_CS:
  	description: Strain number or identifier of the counter-selection strain, if applicable
