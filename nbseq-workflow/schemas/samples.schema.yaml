properties: 
  ID:
    type: string
    description: sample identifier; must be unique within this file, and must NOT contain an underscore.  There must be a pair of raw sequence files in `${raw_sequence_dir}/${sequencing_run_ID}/Sample_${sample_id}/*_{R1,R2}_*.fastq.gz` as described in the README. Generally ID has format `${plate}-${well}`, where `${plate}` and `${well}` refer to positions on the HTS library preparation plates.

  expt:
    type: string
    description: sub-experiment name; must correspond to the same entry in metadata.yaml
  sample:
    type: string
    description: name of the selection, must correspond to the `selection` column in `metadata.csv` above 
    minLength: 1
  round:
    type: string
    description: selection round, in format `R{r}{io}` where `{r}` is replaced by the round number and `{io}` is replaced with `i` for input (e.g. post-amplification) or `o` for output (e.g. pre-amplification). Columns named `r` and `io` will be generated in `metadata_full.csv` containing these values. 
    pattern: "^R\\d+[io][\\-\\+]?$"
  phage_library:
    type: string
    description: name of the input VHH library, for the sake of determining the applicable reference sequence and related parameters. Must correspond to a key within the `libraries` entry in `config.yaml`
